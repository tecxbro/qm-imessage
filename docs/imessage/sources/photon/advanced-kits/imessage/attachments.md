# Attachments

> Upload files, inspect metadata, and stream attachment downloads

`im.attachments` uploads file bytes to the server, reads attachment metadata, and downloads attachments in chunks. Sending an attachment message is a two-step flow: upload the file to get an attachment GUID, then pass that GUID to the [messages API](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/messages).

Message sends accept server attachment GUIDs. They do not accept local file paths.

## What You Can Do

| Need                        | Use this when                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upload a regular attachment | You are sending an image, video, audio file, document, or archive         |
| Upload a Live Photo         | You have a HEIC/HEIF still image plus the matching MOV companion video    |
| Read metadata               | You need the file name, MIME type, size, or transfer state                |
| Stream a download           | You need the attachment bytes; Live Photos may include a companion stream |

## Upload an Attachment

A regular attachment needs two fields: `fileName` and `data`. After upload, send `uploaded.attachment.guid`.

```ts theme={null}
const uploaded = await im.attachments.upload({
  fileName: "photo.jpg",
  data: await readFile("photo.jpg"),
});

await im.messages.sendAttachment(chat.guid, uploaded.attachment.guid);
```

`upload(...)` returns `UploadAttachmentResult`. For a regular attachment, use the `attachment` field:

```jsonc theme={null}
{
  "attachment": {
    "guid": "attachment-guid",
    "fileName": "photo.jpg",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
    "totalBytes": 123456,
    "transferState": "finished"
  }
}
```

Input shape:

```jsonc theme={null}
{
  "fileName": "photo.jpg",           // Display file name; keep the extension when you can
  "data":     [255, 216, 255]        // Uint8Array; raw file bytes
}
```

| Input      | Rule                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fileName` | Display file name. Include an extension when possible. The server sanitizes path characters; an empty value falls back to `attachment`. |
| `data`     | Raw file bytes. Must not be empty.                                                                                                      |

The file extension is not strictly required. The server first tries to detect MIME / UTI from the bytes, then falls back to the `fileName` extension. Files without an extension can still upload, but unknown types may be labeled `application/octet-stream` / `public.data`, which usually gives recipients a worse preview. Keep extensions for documents, archives, and Office files.

Each uploaded file is limited to `100 MiB` by default.

### Common Formats

The SDK uploads raw bytes and the server stores them as-is. Messages.app and Apple's delivery path decide how the recipient sees the file: inline preview, file attachment, transcoded media, or an iCloud link.

| Type      | Common formats                                         | Notes                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Images    | HEIC, HEIF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, WebP, AVIF, SVG | Non-Apple environments may need conversion                                    |
| Video     | MOV, MP4, WebM                                         | Apple may transcode depending on recipient device support                     |
| Audio     | M4A, MP3, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, CAF                         | Pass `isAudioMessage: true` to `sendAttachment(...)` for the audio-message UI |
| Documents | PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, TXT, CSV, JSON, HTML, XML, RTF  | Preview behavior depends on the recipient device                              |
| Archives  | ZIP, TAR, GZ, BZ2, XZ                                  | Usually delivered as file attachments                                         |

<Warning>
  Apple may reject, compress, or convert payloads that are too large or not supported by the recipient path. The SDK uploads bytes; it does not control the final presentation.
</Warning>

## Upload a Live Photo

A Live Photo is a paired upload: the primary file is a HEIC/HEIF image, and `companion.data` is the matching QuickTime `.MOV` video. When sending, still pass only `livePhoto.attachment.guid`.

```ts theme={null}
const livePhoto = await im.attachments.upload({
  fileName: "live-photo.HEIC",
  data: await readFile("live-photo.HEIC"),
  companion: {
    data: await readFile("live-photo.MOV"),
  },
});

await im.messages.sendAttachment(chat.guid, livePhoto.attachment.guid);
```

When the Live Photo upload succeeds, `UploadAttachmentResult` includes both `attachment` and `companion`:

```jsonc theme={null}
{
  "attachment": {                    // HEIC/HEIF primary image
    "guid": "attachment-guid",
    "fileName": "live-photo.HEIC",
    "mimeType": "image/heic",
    "totalBytes": 123456,
    "transferState": "finished"
  },
  "companion": {                     // Paired MOV video
    "fileName": "live-photo.MOV",
    "mimeType": "video/quicktime",
    "totalBytes": 456789,
    "kind": "live-photo-video"
  }
}
```

The primary file and companion file are counted separately. Each defaults to the `100 MiB` upload limit.

<Warning>
  Do not pass a `.MOV` file as the primary `fileName`. A Live Photo primary file should be HEIC/HEIF; the MOV belongs in `companion.data`.
</Warning>

## Get Metadata

You do not need `get(...)` before sending an attachment. Use it when you need to inspect attachment state, display file information, or confirm that a file is ready before downloading.

```ts theme={null}
const attachment = await im.attachments.get(uploaded.attachment.guid);

console.log(attachment.fileName, attachment.mimeType, attachment.totalBytes);
```

Returns `AttachmentInfo`. Use `transferState` to decide whether the attachment is ready to download. Missing or unresolvable attachments throw `NotFoundError`.

```jsonc theme={null}
{
  "guid":          "attachment-guid",   // Attachment GUID used for sending and downloading
  "fileName":      "photo.jpg",         // Stored file name
  "mimeType":      "image/jpeg",        // Server-detected MIME type
  "uti":           "public.jpeg",       // Apple Uniform Type Identifier
  "totalBytes":    123456,              // File size in bytes
  "transferState": "finished",          // Current transfer state
  "isOutgoing":    true,                // Uploaded by the current account
  "isHidden":      false,               // Hidden by Apple, for example inline preview artifacts
  "isSticker":     false,               // Used as a sticker
  "companionKind": "live-photo-video",  // Companion kind; may be absent
  "originalGuid":  "original-guid"      // Original attachment GUID; may be absent
}
```

`transferState` can be:

| Value            | Meaning                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `"pending"`      | Waiting to transfer                 |
| `"transferring"` | Transfer in progress                |
| `"failed"`       | Transfer failed                     |
| `"finished"`     | Ready                               |
| `"unknown"`      | Server could not classify the state |

## Stream Downloads

Before downloading, check that `transferState === "finished"` when you can. Otherwise the server may throw `attachmentNotReady`.

```ts theme={null}
for await (const frame of im.attachments.downloadStream(attachment.guid)) {
  switch (frame.type) {
    case "header":
      console.log(frame.info.fileName, frame.info.mimeType);
      break;

    case "primaryChunk":
      // Append frame.data to the primary output file.
      break;

    case "companionChunk":
      // Append frame.data to the Live Photo companion output file.
      break;
  }
}
```

The stream emits one `header` frame first, followed by data chunks. Regular attachments only emit `primaryChunk`; Live Photos may also emit `companionChunk`.

| `frame.type`     | Meaning                                   | Extra fields             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `header`         | First frame with metadata                 | `info`, `companionInfo?` |
| `primaryChunk`   | Chunk from the primary file               | `data`                   |
| `companionChunk` | Chunk from the Live Photo companion video | `data`                   |

```jsonc theme={null}
{
  "type": "header",
  "info": {                            // Primary AttachmentInfo
    "guid": "attachment-guid",
    "fileName": "photo.jpg"
  },
  "companionInfo": {                   // Present only for Live Photo downloads
    "fileName": "live-photo.MOV",
    "kind": "live-photo-video",
    "mimeType": "video/quicktime",
    "totalBytes": 456789
  }
}
```

Breaking out of the `for await` loop cancels the download.

| Case                              | Result                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attachment does not exist         | Throws `NotFoundError`                                                       |
| Attachment is not ready           | Throws `ValidationError`, with `error.code === ErrorCode.attachmentNotReady` |
| `header.companionInfo` is present | This is a Live Photo download; later frames may include `companionChunk`     |

If an attachment is not ready, poll `get(...)` until `transferState` becomes `"finished"`, then call `downloadStream(...)`.

Minimal save-to-file example:

```ts theme={null}
const { writeFile } = await import("node:fs/promises");

let primaryFileName = "attachment";
let companionFileName: string | undefined;
const primaryChunks: Uint8Array[] = [];
const companionChunks: Uint8Array[] = [];

for await (const frame of im.attachments.downloadStream(attachment.guid)) {
  switch (frame.type) {
    case "header":
      primaryFileName = frame.info.fileName;
      companionFileName = frame.companionInfo?.fileName;
      break;

    case "primaryChunk":
      primaryChunks.push(frame.data);
      break;

    case "companionChunk":
      companionChunks.push(frame.data);
      break;
  }
}

await writeFile(primaryFileName, Buffer.concat(primaryChunks));

if (companionFileName && companionChunks.length > 0) {
  await writeFile(companionFileName, Buffer.concat(companionChunks));
}
```
