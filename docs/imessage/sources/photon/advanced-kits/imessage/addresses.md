# Addresses

> Check whether an email address or phone number can be used with iMessage

`im.addresses` works with contact addresses before they become chats. An address is a full email address or an E.164 phone number. It is not a chat GUID, a contact display name, or a short code.

Use this namespace when you need to answer one of these questions:

| Need                                                                         | Use                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Can this email or phone number currently receive iMessage?                   | `im.addresses.isIMessageAvailable(address)` |
| What address, country, and delivery services does the server have on record? | `im.addresses.get(address)`                 |
| Is this recipient currently silencing notifications with Focus?              | `im.addresses.isFocusSilenced(address)`     |

`im.addresses` only checks address-level state. After you have a `chat.guid`, send, edit, unsend, reply, and notify through the [messages API](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/messages).

## Input Format

Every `im.addresses` method accepts the same `address` argument:

| Input                        | Accepted | Example                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Full email address           | Yes      | `alice@example.com`       |
| E.164 phone number           | Yes      | `+15551234567`            |
| Chat GUID                    | No       | `any;-;alice@example.com` |
| Display name                 | No       | `Alice`                   |
| Short code or service number | No       | `12345`                   |

Phone numbers must be E.164: include the country code, start with `+`, and omit spaces, parentheses, and dashes.

## Common Flow

Before you create a new chat, the most common preflight check is iMessage availability:

| Step | Action                      | Method                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Check iMessage availability | `im.addresses.isIMessageAvailable(address)` |
| 2    | Create or resolve the chat  | `im.chats.create([address])`                |
| 3    | Send the message            | `im.messages.sendText(chat.guid, text)`     |

```ts theme={null}
const address = "alice@example.com";

const available = await im.addresses.isIMessageAvailable(address);

if (!available) {
  throw new Error(`${address} is not available on iMessage`);
}

const { chat } = await im.chats.create([address]);
await im.messages.sendText(chat.guid, "Hello");
```

`isIMessageAvailable(...)` is a check only. It does not create a chat. `im.chats.create(...)` creates or resolves the chat and returns the `chat.guid` used by message APIs.

## Check iMessage Availability

```ts theme={null}
const available = await im.addresses.isIMessageAvailable("+15551234567");
```

Returns `boolean`:

| Return value | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`       | Apple currently reports that this address can be reached over iMessage |
| `false`      | The address is unavailable, or availability could not be confirmed     |

Use this before starting a new conversation when you want to avoid sending iMessage traffic to an address that is clearly unreachable.

<Note>
  Availability is a live Apple lookup. `true` means it is reasonable to continue creating a chat and sending a message, but it does not guarantee that the later send will succeed. Network conditions, account state, or Apple service state can still change.
</Note>

## Get Address Details

```ts theme={null}
const info = await im.addresses.get("alice@example.com");
console.log(info.address, info.country, info.services);
```

Returns `MultiServiceAddressInfo`:

| Field      | Type                | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`  | `string`            | The server's stored form of the email address or E.164 phone number |
| `country`  | `string \| null`    | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, or `null` when unknown             |
| `services` | `ChatServiceType[]` | Available services: `"iMessage"`, `"SMS"`, `"RCS"`, or `"unknown"`  |

`get(...)` throws `NotFoundError` when the server has no record for the address.

<Note>
  If you only need to know whether the address can use iMessage, call `isIMessageAvailable(...)`. Use `get(...)` when you need address details such as country or available services.
</Note>

## Check Focus Status

```ts theme={null}
const silenced = await im.addresses.isFocusSilenced("alice@example.com");
```

Returns `boolean`:

| Return value | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `true`       | Notifications from this address may currently be silenced by Focus |
| `false`      | No Focus silence state was detected                                |

Focus is a live Apple state, not a long-term recipient preference. This method tells you whether the recipient may be silencing notifications right now. To trigger Apple's "Notify Anyway" action after sending, use [`im.messages.notifySilenced(...)`](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/messages#notify-anyway) with `chat.guid` and `message.guid`.

## Next Steps

1. [Chats](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/chats) — create a chat from an address and get `chat.guid`
2. [Messages](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/messages) — send text, attachments, and replies with `chat.guid`
3. [Error Handling](/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/error-handling) — handle `NotFoundError`, retries, and structured error context
