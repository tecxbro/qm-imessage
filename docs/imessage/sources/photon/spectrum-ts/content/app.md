# App

> Send and update a tappable app card, with optional live rendering on supported platforms.

export const TypeTooltip = ({name, type, children}) => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);
  const [pos, setPos] = React.useState({
    top: 0,
    left: 0
  });
  const triggerRef = React.useRef(null);
  const show = () => {
    if (triggerRef.current) {
      const rect = triggerRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
      setPos({
        top: rect.bottom + 6,
        left: rect.left
      });
    }
    setVisible(true);
  };
  const hide = () => setVisible(false);
  return <>
      <span ref={triggerRef} onMouseEnter={show} onMouseLeave={hide} style={{
    cursor: "pointer",
    position: "relative",
    display: "inline"
  }}>
        {children || <code>{name}</code>}
      </span>
      {visible && <span style={{

    zIndex: 9999,
    padding: "8px 12px",
    borderRadius: "8px",

    lineHeight: "1.5",
    fontFamily: "'Azeret Mono', monospace",
    whiteSpace: "pre",
    backgroundColor: "var(--tw-prose-pre-bg, #1e1e1e)",
    color: "var(--tw-prose-pre-code, #e5e5e5)",
    border: "1px solid var(--border, rgba(128,128,128,0.2))",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)",

          {type}
        </span>}
    </>;
};

Use `app()` when you want to present a URL as a tappable card instead of an inline link.

## Send an app card

The first argument is <TypeTooltip name="AppUrl" type={`type AppUrl = string | Promise<string> | (() => string | Promise<string>);`} />. The only thing a caller supplies: the URL. It is itself consumable — pass a string, a promise, or a thunk (sync or async). The thunk form lets the URL be computed at send time (e.g. minting a signed link).

```ts theme={null}
import { app } from "spectrum-ts";

await space.send(app("https://example.com/deep-link"));
```

On iMessage, the recipient gets a native iMessage App card. On Slack, Telegram,
WhatsApp, and terminal, Spectrum sends the URL using that platform's normal
link behavior.

## Show the app's live UI

The second argument is <TypeTooltip name="AppOptions" type={`interface AppOptions {
live?: boolean;
}`} />.

Set `live` to `true` to request live rendering:

```ts theme={null}
import { app } from "spectrum-ts";

await space.send(
  app("https://example.com/dashboard", {
    live: true,
  })
);
```

<Accordion title="AppOptions" description="Optional rendering behavior for an app card.">
  | Option  | Type      | Description                                                                 |
  | ------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `live?` | `boolean` | Render the installed app extension's live UI when the platform supports it. |
</Accordion>

When `live` is omitted, iMessage shows the card's static URL preview. Platforms without a live app surface ignore the option and keep their normal URL fallback.

<Note>
  `live` is a rendering hint. The recipient needs a supported platform and the
  corresponding app extension for its live UI to appear.
</Note>

## Update an app card in place

An iMessage app card sent through `@spectrum-ts/imessage` can be updated without sending a second bubble. Keep the message returned by the original send, then pass it to `edit()`:

```ts theme={null}
import { app, edit } from "spectrum-ts";

const card = await space.send(
  app("https://example.com/order/123", {
    live: true,
  })
);

await space.send(
  edit(
    app("https://example.com/order/123?status=shipped", {
      live: true,
    }),
    card
  )
);
```

The recipient sees the existing card update in place. You can change its URL, generated layout, and live-rendering option.

Keep using `card` for later updates. `space.send(edit(...))` resolves to `undefined`; it does not return a replacement message.

<Note>
  In-place app-card updates require `@spectrum-ts/imessage`. They are not
  available through `@spectrum-ts/imessage-local` or the URL fallbacks on other
  providers.
</Note>

### How update sessions work

A successful iMessage App send returns an iMessage message with
`miniAppCardSession` metadata. Spectrum passes this session back to iMessage
when you call `edit()` and refreshes it after each successful update.

Most applications should treat `miniAppCardSession` as provider-managed
metadata: keep the original returned message and let Spectrum use it. A message
without this metadata cannot identify an existing iMessage App card to update.

## How iMessage delivers app cards

On iMessage, app cards open inside the [Spectrum iMessage App](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/spectrum-by-photon/id6777616651),
an iMessage App launcher approved by Apple. Recipients download it once on
first use (they can download it directly inside the Messages app); after that,
every app card you send opens directly in Messages without leaving the
conversation.

The launcher keeps a library of every iMessage App a recipient has opened, so
they can reopen those apps later or share them with friends.

For an iMessage extension with its own identity and layout control, see
[Customized iMessage Apps](/docs/spectrum-ts/providers/imessage/messaging-features/apps).
