# Read

> Mark a conversation as read, and observe when a recipient reads what you sent.

Use `read()` to mark a conversation as read up to a message, surfacing a read receipt to the sender where the platform supports one. It is fire-and-forget: `space.send(...)` resolves to `undefined`.

```ts theme={null}
import { read } from "spectrum-ts";

await space.send(read(message));
```

`message.read()` and `space.read(message)` are sugar for the canonical form above.

```ts theme={null}
await message.read();
await space.read(message);
```

Only inbound messages can be marked read; passing an outbound message throws at build time, before the send pipeline runs.

Granularity is per-platform:

* **WhatsApp Business** — a per-message receipt, which also marks every earlier message in the conversation as read.
* **iMessage** (remote) — chat-level: the target only identifies the chat, and **every** unread message in it is marked read. Local mode rejects with an <TypeTooltip name="UnsupportedError" type={`declare class UnsupportedError extends Error {
  readonly kind: UnsupportedKind;
  readonly platform?: string;
  readonly contentType?: string;
  readonly action?: string;
  readonly detail?: string;
  constructor(opts: UnsupportedErrorOptions);
  static content(contentType: string, platform?: string, detail?: string): UnsupportedError;
  static action(action: string, platform?: string, detail?: string): UnsupportedError;
  withPlatform(platform: string): UnsupportedError;
  }`} />.
* **Telegram / Slack** — silently no-op. Neither surfaces read state for bot conversations, so the signal is vacuously satisfied — the same best-effort contract as `typing`.

## Inbound read receipts

When a recipient reads a message the agent sent, the same content type arrives as an inbound <TypeTooltip name="Message" type={`interface Message<TPlatform extends string = string, TSender extends User = User, TSpace extends Space = Space> {
content: Content;
direction: "inbound" | "outbound";
edit(newContent: ContentInput): Promise<void>;
readonly id: string;
platform: TPlatform;
react(reaction: string): Promise<(Message<TPlatform, AgentSender, TSpace> & {
    content: Reaction;
}) | undefined>;
read(): Promise<void>;
reply(content: ContentInput): Promise<Message<TPlatform, AgentSender, TSpace> | undefined>;
reply(...content: [
    ContentInput,
    ContentInput,
    ...ContentInput[]
]): Promise<Message<TPlatform, AgentSender, TSpace>[]>;
sender: TSender | undefined;
space: TSpace;
timestamp: Date;
unsend(): Promise<void>;
}`} /> on `app.messages`. iMessage (dedicated and shared lines) reports these today.

```ts theme={null}
for await (const [space, message] of app.messages) {
  if (message.content.type === "read") {
    const target = message.content.target; // the message YOU sent
    console.log(
      `${message.sender?.id} read "${target.id}" at ${message.timestamp.toISOString()}`
    );
  }
}
```

The envelope carries the event semantics:

* `message.sender` is the **reader**; `message.content.target` is the message **you** sent. Never the other way round.
* The target is a fully-built `Message` with `direction: "outbound"`, so `target.content`, `target.edit(...)`, and `target.unsend()` are all available on it.
* `message.timestamp` is when the reader's device marked it read — not when your process observed the event. The two diverge when a receipt arrives late via Continuity sync.
* `message.sender` is always present on an inbound read receipt. Receipts the platform could not attribute to a reader are dropped rather than surfaced with an unknown sender, so a "who has read this" tally never counts phantom readers.
* **Direct messages are the reliable case today.** iMessage does not report the reader's identity on a read event — it names the receiving line instead — so in a DM the reader is recovered from the conversation itself. A group conversation carries no such information, so a group receipt is dropped unless the platform names a reader other than your own line. Treat group read receipts as best-effort.
* Where a group does report readers, it emits one message per reader, all sharing the same `content.target.id`. Aggregate by that id against `space.getMembers()` to answer "has everyone read it".
* The agent's own actions are suppressed: `space.read(...)` does not echo back as an inbound event.
* No direction check is needed. Outbound `read` is fire-and-forget and produces no `Message`, so `content.type === "read"` on `app.messages` is always a receipt.

Aggregating across a group:

```ts theme={null}
const readers = new Map<string, Set<string>>(); // target id -> reader ids

for await (const [space, message] of app.messages) {
  if (message.content.type !== "read") continue;

  const targetId = message.content.target.id;
  const seen = readers.get(targetId) ?? new Set();
  seen.add(message.sender?.id ?? "");
  readers.set(targetId, seen);

  const members = await space.getMembers();
  if (seen.size >= members.length - 1) {
    console.log(`everyone read ${targetId}`);
  }
}
```
