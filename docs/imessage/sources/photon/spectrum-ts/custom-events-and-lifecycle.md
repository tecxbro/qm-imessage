# Custom Events and Lifecycle

> Platform-specific event streams and graceful shutdown

export const TypeTooltip = ({name, type, children}) => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);
  const [pos, setPos] = React.useState({
    top: 0,
    left: 0
  });
  const triggerRef = React.useRef(null);
  const show = () => {
    if (triggerRef.current) {
      const rect = triggerRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
      setPos({
        top: rect.bottom + 6,
        left: rect.left
      });
    }
    setVisible(true);
  };
  const hide = () => setVisible(false);
  return <>
      <span ref={triggerRef} onMouseEnter={show} onMouseLeave={hide} style={{
    cursor: "pointer",
    position: "relative",
    display: "inline"
  }}>
        {children || <code>{name}</code>}
      </span>
      {visible && <span style={{
    position: "fixed",
    top: pos.top,
    left: pos.left,
    zIndex: 9999,
    padding: "8px 12px",
    borderRadius: "8px",
    fontSize: "13px",
    lineHeight: "1.5",
    fontFamily: "'Azeret Mono', monospace",
    whiteSpace: "pre",
    backgroundColor: "var(--tw-prose-pre-bg, #1e1e1e)",
    color: "var(--tw-prose-pre-code, #e5e5e5)",
    border: "1px solid var(--border, rgba(128,128,128,0.2))",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)",

          {type}
        </span>}
    </>;
};

## Custom events

Platform providers can emit events beyond messages — typing indicators, presence, delivery status, whatever the provider chooses to surface. Spectrum exposes each event as a flat async iterable on the app instance:

```ts theme={null}
for await (const event of app.typing) {
  console.log(`${event.platform}: typing event received`);
}
```

The property name matches the event name the provider declared. Events are merged across every provider that emits them, and each payload is annotated with a `platform` field so you know the source.

### Lazy streams

Event streams are created lazily on first access. Accessing `app.typing` once kicks off the underlying listener; subsequent iterations share the same source.

### Per-platform access

The same events are available on a narrowed platform instance, scoped to that platform only:

```ts theme={null}
import { imessage } from "spectrum-ts/providers/imessage";

const im = imessage(app);
for await (const event of im.typing) {
  // iMessage-only typing events
}
```

Use the flat form on `app` when you want a merged feed across platforms; use the narrowed form when you only care about one.

### Fusor custom events

Fusor-backed providers can emit non-message events (presence, delivery status) into typed event streams using `fusorEvent`. The helper returns a <TypeTooltip name="FusorEvent" type={`interface FusorEvent<TName extends string = string, TData = unknown> {
readonly data: TData;
readonly name: TName;
readonly [FUSOR_EVENT_BRAND]: true;
}`} /> envelope. Return a `fusorEvent(name, data)` from a Fusor `messages` handler to push it into an `app.<name>` stream:

```ts theme={null}
import { fusorEvent } from "spectrum-ts";

return fusorEvent("presence", { userId: update.userId, online: true });
```

Return an array when one webhook delivery produces both messages and custom events. Events emitted this way are available as `app.presence` (merged across providers) or `narrowedInstance.presence` (scoped to the emitting provider). Provider event declarations type the resulting streams. The `fusorEvent` helper itself accepts any name and data, so an undeclared event name produces a runtime warning.

## Lifecycle

### Graceful shutdown

```ts theme={null}
await app.stop();
```

This closes the merged message stream, drains and disposes every custom event stream, tears down every platform client via its `lifecycle.destroyClient` hook (if one is defined), and flushes any pending telemetry data when [telemetry](/docs/spectrum-ts/getting-started#telemetry) is enabled. It's idempotent — calling `stop()` twice is safe.

### Signal handling

Spectrum registers `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` handlers on startup. When a signal fires:

1. `stop()` is invoked with a 3-second timeout.
2. If cleanup completes in time, the process exits with code 0.
3. If not, the process exits with code 1.

You don't need to wire this up yourself — running your app in a container with `docker stop` or hitting Ctrl-C in a terminal will drain cleanly.

### When to call `stop()` manually

* You're embedding Spectrum in a longer-running process and want to tear it down without exiting.
* You're writing tests that create and dispose an app per case.
* You want deterministic cleanup before re-initializing with a different provider set.
